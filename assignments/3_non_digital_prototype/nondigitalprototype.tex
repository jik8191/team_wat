The bar at the top represents what action the playersmust take on each beat of the song. If the rhythm ticker is on a spacewith no action, the players are free to perform any action on thegameboard except standing idle. If the rhythm ticker is hovered overan action icon on the rhythm bar the players must take that action onthe map to move onto the next action. If players miss a specifiedaction, the players lose and restart from the starting tile. A pictureof a sword indicates players must land on the same tile as an enemy toattack and defeat that enemy. A picture of the blue circle means thatthe players must land on the blue circle which completes the level.\\The players have three actions they can take. First, they can move onetile in any cardinal direction. This action is available on all threelevels. Second, players can jump. This allows them to move two tilesin any one cardinal direction. This action is only allowed on themedium and hard levels. Finally, the players can freezeenemies. Players are only allowed to freeze once per level and thisaction is only allowed on the hard level. When the players use freeze,all enemies on the board stop moving for the next three players'actions and then resume movement as normal.\pagebreak\section*{Pictures}\begin{figure}[!htb]\begin{center}\resizebox{3.0in}{!}{\includegraphics{img/andrew.jpg}}\end{center}\caption{Andrew enjoying our non-digital prototype \label{andrew}}\end{figure}\begin{figure}[!htb]\begin{center}\leavevmode\resizebox{4.0in}{!}{\includegraphics{img/level_easy.jpg}}\end{center}\caption{Easy Level \label{level_easy}}\end{figure}\begin{figure}[!htb]\begin{center}\leavevmode\resizebox{4.0in}{!}{\includegraphics{img/level_medium.jpg}}\end{center}\caption{Medium Level \label{level_medium}}\end{figure}\begin{figure}[!htb]\begin{center}\leavevmode\resizebox{4.0in}{!}{\includegraphics{img/level_hard.jpg}}\end{center}\caption{Hard Level \label{level_hard}}\end{figure}\end{document}
