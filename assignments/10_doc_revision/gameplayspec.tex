The evil DJ hasturned all the other dance party attendees into evil versions of theircostumes! The main character must traverse the dance floor throughhordes of monsters to reach the DJ and save them all with the power ofmusic. \\Players must solve challenging environmental puzzles as theyperform rhythm based actions to the beat of the dance music. Along theway, they will discover useful new abilities that allow players tochoose how they'll fight and navigate the dance floor.\section*{Design Philosophy}Rhythm Knights focuses on creating a wacky costume dance party withpossessed enemy characters taking on the role of their costumes. Thedastardly DJ is trying to control the crowd, while the main charactermust match the fast-paced techno-music of the DJ to conquer the dancefloor. Players must make every action on the beat of the music andthink fast in order to progress through the obstacles on the dancefloor.As a rhythm game, there will be distinct visual and audio feedback tohelp players feel more in sync with the beat. The environment of thegame will be responsive to the beat of the music and will reflect themusical tone and pattern. Enemy movement, player movement, and tickerprogression all occur in sync with the beat.\section*{Objectives}The main objective for each dance floor is to reach the exit in orderto get closer to the DJ, all while completing actions in time to thebeat of the song. Players will be judged on their ability tosuccessfully chain together long strings of successful actionsPlayers must perform the action highlighted by the current-actionindicator on the ticker through a series of buttoncombinations. Failing to perform an action on the designated beat ormistiming an action will decrease player health. Thus, players mustmaintain health above zero at all times. By performing well, playerhealth will gradually replenish.\pagebreak\section*{Actions}\begin{table}[h]\begin{tabular}{|l|L{2cm}|L{4cm}|L{4cm}|l|}\hline\textbf{Verb} & \textbf{Input} & \textbf{Outcome}  & \textbf{Limitations} & \textbf{Importance} \\\hlineMove & WASD  & Player attempts to moves one space in specified direction  & Must be done on rhythm, cannot move onto obstacle tile & Critical   \\\hlineDash & Double Tap WASD & Player attempts to moves two spaces in  specified direction  & Must be done on rhythm, cannot dash through obstacles & Desirable   \\\hlineCast Freeze & Press two direction keys & Freeze all enemies in range until end of bar & Must be done on rhythm, can only be used once per level & Desirable\\\hlineShoot & Hold down a direction key for one beat & Shoot a fireball in a straight line & Must be done on rhythm & Desirable  \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{table}\pagebreak\section*{Interactions}\begin{table}[h]\begin{tabular}{|l|L{4cm}|L{2cm}|L{3cm}|l|}\hline\textbf{Interaction} & \textbf{Trigger} & \textbf{Control}  & \textbf{Outcome} & \textbf{Importance} \\\hlineUnsynchronized action & Attempt an action off-rhythm & Any action & Player loses health if vulnerable, becomes invulnerable (see resume moving)& Critical \\\hline Attack enemy & Attempt to move onto a tile occupied by an enemy & Move or dash & Enemy is damaged & Desirable \\\hlineIncorrect action & Do not perform action specified by ticker & Any action other than the one specified & Nothing happens & Desirable \\\hlineInvalid dash & Attempt to jump with only one space available & Jump & Player moves forward instead & Valuable \\\hlineFailure to act within a beat & Perform no action on a beat      & None       & Player loses health if vulnerable, becomes invulnerable (see resume moving)  & Desirable\\\hlineResume moving & Perform an action specified by the ticker while invulnerable &Any action & Player becomes vulnerable to damage & Desirable\\\hline\end{tabular}\end{table}\pagebreak\section*{Challenges}\subsection*{Matching specified actions with the beat of the music}Players will have to move to the beat of the music. In addition,players will also be faced with a choice of choosing special abilitiesin order to conquer an obstacle while navigating the dancefloor. Players will have to align themselves relative to enemiesdepending upon how they want to attack.\subsection*{Continuing movement once a level is started}Players will have to move in sync with the beat of the music in orderto build up a combo meter. Players that don't keep up with the beat ofthe music will lose health and combos. However, if they miss a beatplayers will become invincible and have as much time as they need toreorient themselves to the beat.\subsection*{Avoiding Enemy Attacks}Some enemies will have the ability to attack players, so this another thing they must keep in mind while planning out their route. \end{document}
