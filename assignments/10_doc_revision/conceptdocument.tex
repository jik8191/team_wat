All of the other party attendees have been turned into monsterzombies because of the music being played by the evil DJ. You mustwithstand hordes of monsters to reach the DJ and save them all withthe power of music.\section*{Features}\begin{itemize}\item Time your actions to the beat to build up combos and score points\item Slash through hordes of enemies with your trusty neon saber\item Dash over perilous pits to cross the dancefloor\item Shoot glowing projectiles to defeat enemies\item Freeze enemies in their tracks\end{itemize}\section*{Design Goals}\begin{itemize}\item  \textbf{Rhythm Centric Combat} - The goal of the game is to test the  players' abilities to follow along with the rhythm of the music. The  players should feel like they are at a wacky 21st century dance party  and the combination of techno music and rhythm based combat is geared  towards a younger audience attracted to electronic dance music.\item  \textbf{Play Style} - Players must react quickly to changes in the  music and the environment around them. The game emphasizes timing  accuracy, long combo streaks, and short-down time between objectives.\end{itemize}\pagebreak\section*{Market Segment}\subsection*{Genre}This is an action rhythm game. The players must defeat enemies by timing their actions to the displayed beat sequence. \subsection*{Platform}Rhythm Knights is designed for the desktop and will be played with a keyboard. It is also recommended that players have headphones for optimal danciness. \subsection*{Competition}\begin{itemize}\item Dance Dance Revolution (series): DDR's mechanics involve hitting  keys to the beat of the music and the players must match a specific  key pattern to progress through the level. In its core, this is one of  the main mechanics of our game.\item Guitar Hero (series): Similarly to DDR, Guitar Hero involves  matching a key pattern to the beat of the music, so we again have an  overlap of mechanics.\item This is probably the main competition for our game. Crypt of the  Necrodancer has similar themes. It is a game about fighting monsters  while confined to a rhythm. However, Crypt of the Necrodancer focuses  on exploration and Rogue-like elements, while Rhythm Knights focuses on  puzzle elements and consistently acting on a different beat for each  level.\end{itemize}\subsection*{Unique Selling Points}There will be different genres of music for each level using uniquerhythms on dance floor environments inspired by the world. Some levelswill have a more basic map and a complicated rhythm, while others willhave a more complex map and a basic rhythm. A different beat style ineach level will make for a new experience every time. The game'srhythm ``ticker'' will dictate what actions players are allowed toperform on a given beat. Players will also be given the choice ofspecial abilities such as dashing, freezing, and shooting on certainbeats of the music.\pagebreak\section*{Gameplay Sketches}\begin{figure}[!htb]\begin{center}\leavevmode\includegraphics[width=4.7in]{img/splash.jpg}\end{center}\caption{Current splash screen for Rhythm Knights \label{splashscreen}}\end{figure}\begin{figure}[htb!]\begin{subfigure}{.5\textwidth}  \centering  \includegraphics[width= 1.5in]{img/enemy_front.jpg}  \caption{Front view of enemy  \label{en_front}}\end{subfigure}%\begin{subfigure}{.5\textwidth}  \centering  \includegraphics[width=1.5in]{img/enemy_side.jpg}  \caption{Side view of enemy  \label{en_side}}\end{subfigure}%\caption{Enemy views\label{enemy}}\end{figure}\begin{figure}[!htb]\begin{center}\leavevmode\includegraphics{img/main_char.jpg}\end{center}\caption{A sketch of our main character \label{logo}}\end{figure}\begin{figure}[!htb]\begin{center}\leavevmode\resizebox{4.7in}{!}{\includegraphics{img/play_screen.jpg}}\end{center}\caption{ This is a rough example of what levels will look like(currently with placeholder assets).
