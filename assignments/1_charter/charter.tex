Our group, \textit{\teamname}, has come up with the following charter.
All team members have read and approve of this charter. The team has also
discussed our individual expectations for a grade in this course.

\section*{Team Roles}

\teammember{Kylar Henderson}{Project Leader}\\
Kylar has experience working 
with groups both within and outside of other courses. She is a CS major and 
has completed all of the core CS classes, including CS 3110. Therefore she 
will also heavily focus on helping with programming in addition to her role 
as project leader.\\
\begin{duties}{Kylar}
  \item Assigning internal deadlines for the group members.
  \item Assigning the lead person for each course document.
  \item Gathering the write-ups from each team member into the two week report. 
  \item Resolving any disputes between the programmers and the designers.
  \item Completing any programming tasks assigned by Gagik.
\end{duties}
\preferredemail{Kylar}{kdh59@cornell.edu}

\teammember{Gagik Hakobyan}{Co-Software Lead}\\
Gagik has taken numerous CS and CS-related courses including CS 4620 and 
AEP 4380.  He’s currently taking Physically Based Animation and Interactive 
Computer Graphics.
\begin{duties}{Gagik}
\item Assign programming roles to the other programmers 
(including project lead and audio).
\item Resolve disputes between designers and programmers.
\item Co-lead creation of architecture spec with Charlie.
\end{duties}

\teammember{Chalrles (Chalie) Tark}{Co-Software Lead}\\
Charlie is a CS major who has taken all of the core CS courses 
(including CS3110).  He has practical experience with web design, UI design, 
and graphics creation, and is comfortable with the Adobe creative suite, 
PaintTool SAI, and other design/illustration tools.  He has some experience 
with music production software such as FL Studio, Reason, and Sony ACID.\\
\begin{duties}{Charlie}
\item{Co-lead creation of architecture spec with Gagik}.
\item{Coordinating specific programming tasks among programmers as necessary.}
\item{Assisting Julia in the creation of  character design assets and other 
art assets (including concept art and promotional assets) as needed.}
\end{duties}
\preferredemail{Charlie}{cyt25@cornell.edu}

\teammember{Julia Cole}{Design Lead}\\Julia is a fine arts major and has taken 
immersive art studio classes for four years. She has had three semesters of 
graphic design, has taken INFO 1300 and ART 2701, and has skills in the 
Adobe suite and several other 2D and 3D studio classes.
\begin{duties}{Julia}
\item{Creating the background art and character design assets for the game.}
\item{Communicating with Gagik and Andrew about how to implement the character animations and other programming/UX needs.}
\item{Resolving any disputes with the other teammates about the visual theme or design.}
\end{duties}
\preferredemail{Julia}{jlc487@cornell.edu}

\teammember{Austin Liu}{Sound Engineer}\\
Austin is an engineering physics major but has taken a fair number of CS 
classes, including CS 3110. He is a classical
musician in his spare time and has prepared music in Lilypond, a music
typesetting program, before. \\
\begin{duties}{Austin}
\item Creating the music and sound effects via Lilypond.
  MIDI files and scores can be generated from Lilypond input files.
\item Coordinating with Julia to ensure that the music and the art complement
  each other
\item Helping Gagik and Charlie with the game programming.
\end{duties}
\preferredemail{Austin}{ayl42@cornell.edu}

\teammember{Andrew Halpern}{UX Designer}\\
Andrew Halpern is an Information Science major and has worked in various 
design groups in INFO 3450 (HCI), INFO 2300 (Web Design), and has experience 
working with user interfaces.\\
\begin{duties}{Andrew}
\item{Designing the game’s menu and other user interface features}
\item{Coordinating with Julia to create the game’s level design}
\item{Conduct gameplay tests and share the results with the rest of the team}
\item{Take minutes during the team’s meeting’s}
\end{duties}
\preferredemail{Andrew}{amh272@cornell.edu. }

\section*{Team Coordination}
\subsection*{Meeting Time}
Thursdays @ 6:30 in CSUG (Upson 361)

\subsection*{Minutes}
Andrew will be in charge of taking minutes at each meeting.

\subsection*{Communication}
Group members should check email at least twice a day. In general, members 
should respond to emails within 24 hours, unless the email is marked as 
``[URGENT]''. In this case members should respond ASAP. 
If a member knows they will not be able to be reached by email for longer than 
6 hours, they should let everyone in the group know. We will also use Facebook 
to contact each other for short messages.

\subsection*{File Sharing}
When Git is set up, everything will be placed on Git, including documents 
(which will be done in \LaTeX).

\section*{Conflict Resolution}

\subsection*{Creative Conflicts}
If any conflicts arise, they should be brought up at the weekly meeting. They 
will be discussed between the group members and if we cannot reach a 
conclusion, there will be a vote. If the vote results in a tie, 
Kylar will make the deciding vote. 

\subsection*{Missed Deadlines}
A missed internal deadline will only be excused if the team member contacts 
Kylar 72 hours before said deadline. Anyone who misses an internal deadline 
has a choice, buy a large cheese pizza for the next meeting or lose points 
(to be determined because we don’t know the grading scheme). If a team member’s 
delay causes a slip to an assignment deadline, this will be included in the 
two-week report of that milestone, with recommendation that it affects the 
student’s individual grade at the end of the semester.
