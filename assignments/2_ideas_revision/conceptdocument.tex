All of the other party attendees have been turned into monsterzombies because of the music being played by the evil DJ. You mustwithstand hordes of monsters to reach the DJ and save them all withthe power of music.\section*{Features}\begin{itemize}\item   Coordinate your actions to the beat of the music\item   Swing a sword\item   Hold up a shield\item   Turn to change direction\item   Cast an Area of Effect attack spell that damages all   enemies within a certain number of squares (freezing, blizzard spell)\item   Dance in place to build up ``Sync''\end{itemize}\section*{Design Goals}\begin{itemize}\item  \textbf{Rhythm Centric Combat} - The goal of the game is to test the  players' abilities to follow along with the rhythm of the music. The  players should feel like they are at a wacky 21st century dance party  and the combination of techno music and rhythm based combat is geared  towards a younger audience attracted to electronic dance music.\item  \textbf{Play Style} - Players must react quickly to changes in the  music and the environment around them. The game emphasizes timing  accuracy, long combo streaks, and short-down time between objectives.\end{itemize}\pagebreak\section*{Market Segment}\subsection*{Genre}This is an action rhythm game. The player must defeat enemies by matching your actions to the incoming ``notes'' of the music.\subsection*{Platform}Our game is designed for the desktop and will be played with a keyboard. It is also recommended that players have headphones for optimal danciness. \subsection*{Competition}\begin{itemize}\item Dance Dance Revolution (series): This is probably the main  competition for our game. DDR's mechanics involve hitting keys to the  beat of the music and the player must match a specific key pattern to  progress through the level. In its core, this is one of the main  mechanics of our game.\item Guitar Hero (series): Similarly to DDR, Guitar hero involves  matching a key pattern to the beat of the music, so we again have an  overlap of mechanics.\item Crypt of the Necrodancer: To a lesser extent, Crypt of the  Necrodancer has similar themes. It is a game about fighting monsters  while confined to a rhythm. However, Crypt of the Necrodancer focuses  on exploration and Rogue-like elements, while our game focuses on  combat.\end{itemize}\subsection*{Unique Selling Points}\begin{itemize}\item Polyrhythms, cross-rhythms (2 on 3, both vertically and  horizontally) are important to achieving larger boosts - consequently,  we will try to draw inspiration from world musics that make use of  this - anything from jazz to sub-saharan African music is fair game.\item Visual feedback into the game that coordinates with the rhythm  so that the game could be played on mute in theory.\item Although it is played like a rhythm game, since it is an  action-hybrid, elements such as Area of Effect spells bring hectic,  combat-style gameplay.\item Certain abilities, such as the Area of Effect spell require the  use of a certain amount of the ``Sync'' bar, which doubles as a HP bar.\end{itemize}\pagebreak\section*{Gameplay Sketches}\begin{figure}[!htb]\begin{center}\leavevmode\includegraphics{img/logo.jpg}\end{center}\caption{Possible logos for our game, if we continue to use the name Rhythm Knights \label{logo}}\end{figure}\begin{figure}[!htb]\begin{center}\leavevmode\includegraphics{img/main_char.jpg}\end{center}\caption{A sketch of our main character \label{logo}}\end{figure}\begin{figure}[!htb]\begin{center}\leavevmode\resizebox{4.7in}{!}{\includegraphics{img/play_sketch.jpg}}\end{center}\caption{ This is what we imagine each level will look like.
