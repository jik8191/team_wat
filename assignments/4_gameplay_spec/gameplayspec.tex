All of the other party attendees havebeen turned into the monsters they were dressed as by the evil DJ! Themain character must traverse the dance floor through hordes ofmonsters to reach the DJ and save them all with the power ofmusic. Players must solve challenging environmental puzzles as theyperform rhythm based actions to the beat of the dance music. Along theway they will discover useful new abilities and tools that add anadditional layer of complexity to each floor.\section*{Design Philosophy}Our game is focused on creating a wacky costume dance party withpossessed enemy characters taking on the role of their costumes. Thedastardly DJ is trying to control the crowd, while the maincharacter's goal is to match the fast-paced techno-music of the DJ toconquer the dance floor. Players must make every action on the beat ofthe music and think fast in order to calculate one of the paths thatlead to the dance floor exit.\\The combination of combat and rhythm elements makes this puzzle gametiming-oriented. Being forced to restart a level is part of thelearning experience in the game. The 'rhythm ticker' is an essentialguide for the player, but players can experiment with a differentcombination of attacks and maneuvers to conquer the dance floor.\\As a puzzle game, our designs will be clean and appealing. A colorful,whimsical setting with quirky animations will keep the player engagednot only mentally, but visually as well. The environment of the gamewill be responsive to the beat of the music and will reflect themusical tone and pattern.\section*{Objectives}The main objective for each dance floor is to match the actionsdisplayed on the rhythm action bar. If players successfully fulfillall the actions required on the action bar players will be able tomove onto the next level. If players cannot match all the actions inthe order given players will be forced to reset the level. Also,players must perform these actions on the beat of the music otherwisethe player will be forced to restart. If there is no action specifiedon the rhythm action bar players are free to perform any action ormaneuver they wish; however, if there are no enemies on the map leftand there are still attack actions specified players must restart thelevel before exiting the dance floor.\section*{Actions}\begin{table}[h]\begin{tabular}{|l|L{2cm}|L{4cm}|L{4cm}|l|}\hline\textbf{Verb} & \textbf{Input} & \textbf{Outcome}  & \textbf{Limitations} & \textbf{Importance} \\\hlineMove & WASD  & Player attempts to moves one space in specified direction  & Must be done on rhythm, cannot move onto obstacle tile & Critical   \\\hlineJump & Double Tap WASD & Player attempts to moves two spaces in specified direction  & Must be done on rhythm, cannot jump through obstacles & Critical   \\\hlineCast Freeze & F & Freeze all enemies for three beats   & Must be done on rhythm, can only be used once per level & Critical   \\\hlineShoot & Space & Shoot in a straight line & Must be done on rhythm, can only shoot in direction being faced & Critical  \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{table}\section*{Interactions}\begin{table}[h]\begin{tabular}{|l|L{4cm}|L{2cm}|L{3cm}|l|}\hline\textbf{Interaction} & \textbf{Trigger} & \textbf{Control}  & \textbf{Outcome} & \textbf{Importance} \\\hlineUnsynchronized action & Attempt an action off-rhythm & Any action & Player dies & Critical \\\hline Attack enemy & Occupy same space as an enemy & Move or jump & Enemy is defeated & Critical \\\hlineShoot enemy & Shot collides with enemy & Shoot & Enemy is defeated & Critical \\\hlineIncorrect action & Player does not perform action specified by ticker & Any action other than the one specified & Player dies  & Critical \\\hlineInvalid jump     & Attempt to jump with only one space available      & Jump   & Player moves forward instead & Valuable \\\hlineMiss a beat      & Perform no action on a beat      & None       & Player dies       & Critical\\\hline\end{tabular}\end{table}\pagebreak\section*{Challenges}\subsection*{Matching specified actions}When trying to match the actions that are given on the rhythm ticker,players will have to plan their actions ahead of time. Plotting out apath can be hard because if a player is off by only one beat, theywill lose the level. Figuring out just the right way to go so that theappropriate actions are taken will take lots of practice from theplayer.\subsection*{Continuing movement once a level is started}Once a level is started, the player must continue making one actionper beat until they reach a checkpoint or the end of the level. Sincethe beat never stops, players must act quickly and will not have timeto think over moves so they need to plan ahead and be ready to changetheir plan if something does not go as expected.\subsection*{Avoiding Enemy Attacks}Some enemies will have the ability to attack the player, so thisanother thing they must keep in mind while planning out their route. Apath might seem good until the player gets hit with a projectile thatwas shot by an enemy several squares away!\end{document}
