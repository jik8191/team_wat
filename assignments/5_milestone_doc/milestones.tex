Theplayer will be required to complete an objective by moving to thebeat. However, no music will be present. The goal of the prototype isto test whether movement on a rhythm is viable in the style of puzzlerthat we are considering.\subsection*{Deliverables}\begin{itemize}\item Test movement on rhythm (player and enemy)\item Test tile-based movement\item Reach goal: rhythm controller prototype\item Sprites for the character, enemies, ticker and board\end{itemize}\subsection*{Tests for Acceptance}\begin{itemize}\item Game doesn't crash after being playtested by entire team\item Enemies and player are in sync (move at the same time)\end{itemize}\subsection*{Risk Assessment}\begin{itemize}\item Movement is relatively simple to implement and should be working\item Coordinating the rhythm and the movement of the enemies might be   challenging.\end{itemize}\subsection*{Contributors}\begin{itemize}  \item Austin, Gagik, Charles, Kylar, and Andrew will be responsible     for their own modules  \item Julia will be responsible for producing character, enemy, ticker,     and board sprites\end{itemize}\pagebreak\section*{Milestone 2: Technical Prototype}\noindent\textbf{Due Mar 16}\\A more thorough test of the music-based elements of the game. Specifically, we will be putting in music for the early levels.\subsection*{Deliverables}\begin{itemize}\item Music support\item At least be able to design the layout of a level\item Rhythm controller complete\item Character design for player character complete\item Character design for enemies and bosses complete\end{itemize}\subsection*{Tests for Acceptance}\begin{itemize}\item 5 different users are able to construct a level\item Rhythm controller doesn't desync noticeably\end{itemize}\subsection*{Risk Assessment}\begin{itemize}\item Music will be tricky to synchronize properly\item Level design and movement should be relatively straightforward\end{itemize}\subsection*{Contributors}\begin{itemize}\item Austin, Gagik, Charles, Kylar, and Andrew will be responsible for   their own modules\item Julia and Andrew will be responsible for producing assets for   backgrounds, and tiles\end{itemize}\pagebreak\section*{Milestone 3: Alpha Release}\noindent\textbf{Due Apr 6}\\The game should have its early levels complete.All game features should be implemented by the time of this release,though some features such as rhythm synchronization may be onlyimplemented at a basic level\subsection*{Deliverables}\begin{itemize}\item Level editor/XML level parser\item Significant amount of music complete (at least 1 possible track   for each early level)\item Menu navigation layout complete\item Working sprites for characters and enemies complete\end{itemize}\subsection*{Tests for Acceptance}\begin{itemize}\item Julia and Andrew must be able to use level editor to design the map   of a level, and place enemies. \item The music will be limited to something Austin has composed or arranged.\end{itemize}\subsection*{Risk Assessment}\begin{itemize}\item Level editor will be the most difficult part of this release\item The level editor likely will not be able to handle polyrhythms   yet due to the complexity of the implementation.\end{itemize}\subsection*{Contributors}\begin{itemize}\item Austin, Gagik, Charles, Kylar, and Andrew will be responsible   for their own modules\item Julia and Andrew will be responsible for producing visual assets\item Austin will finish up the music for each level, with input from   group members on rhythm/melodic decisions\end{itemize}\pagebreak\section*{Milestone 4: Beta Release}\noindent\textbf{Due Apr 20}\\At this stage, the game should have all of its features implemented,though it may be rough around the edges due to minor bugs. It shouldbe fully playable for at least 10 minutes worth of levels by this point.\subsection*{Deliverables}\begin{itemize}\item All music for levels complete, further changes are only to  augment existing tracks with sound effects/minor rhythmic changes\item Polyrhythm support should be working\item Rhythm-synchronized background animation\item Creation of all gameplay levels ready for user testing\item Polished sprites for all characters complete\item Sprites for effects and particles complete\item Sprites for environment complete\item Fully functional user interface and menus complete\end{itemize}\subsection*{Tests for Acceptance}\begin{itemize}\item Level editors should be working fully, including   possibilities for polyrhythm boosts\item All game mechanics should be tested on multiple level designs\end{itemize}\subsection*{Risk Assessment}\begin{itemize}\item Polyrhythm detection and coordination will be the most tricky part\end{itemize}\subsection*{Contributors}\begin{itemize}\item Austin, Gagik, Charles and Kylar will be responsible for their own modules\item Austin will be responsible for composing and arranging the music   for the programmers to work with.\item Julia and Andrew will be responsible for producing visual assets\end{itemize}\pagebreak\section*{Milestone 5: Final Release}\noindent\textbf{Due May 4}\\A complete implementation, if slightly unpolished, version of ourgame, with full support for complex pieces of music.\subsection*{Deliverables}\begin{itemize}\item All reported bugs removed\item Complete and polished visual assets\item Completed 5 songs divided into about 25 tracks for each world that   is linked by a theme\end{itemize}\subsection*{Tests for Acceptance}\begin{itemize}\item At least 10 people play our game without any programming bugs   up to the final level.\item Polyrhythms now tested and working properly\end{itemize}\subsection*{Risk Assessment}\begin{itemize}\item Extensive playtesting will be done to ensure that the   final game is bug free\end{itemize}\subsection*{Contributors}\begin{itemize}\item Austin, Gagik, Charles, Kylar, and Andrew will be responsible  for their own modules\item All group members will provide input on design elements\item Julia and Andrew will be responsible for producing visual assets\end{itemize}\end{document}
