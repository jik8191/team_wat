Option 2 requires some skill, since after the enemies    are shuffled, the player must then engage each enemy one at a    time. Option 3 requires even more skill, as the player must time the    freezing spell to hit all enemies at a close range, and then attack    each of them before they thaw. The tradeoff might be that this spell    is the cheapest option.  \end{itemize}\end{itemize}\section{Formal Mechanics}\begin{itemize}\item Primary verb: Slash enemies to match the beat of the music\item Outcome 1: Kill enemy and gain points and fill the Sync bar   depending on how well-timed the action was\item Outcome 2: Let enemy hit the player, thereby decreasing the player   Sync (If the player Sync reaches 0, it is Game Over and the player can   retry from a checkpoint in the song)\end{itemize}\end{document}
