Gameplay Prototype: First software prototype; a throw-away prototype
in any language.
Technical Prototype: An evolutionary prototype of a
technical component; should be written in LibGDX and Java.
Alpha Release: Basic code complete with a playable level; should include a
level editor
Beta Release: Basic features complete with a several
playable levels. Plans for user testing.
Final Release: Levels complete but perhaps not polished.
Bug fixing only at this point.

Deliverables: What do you expect to show us in class for this
particular milestone?  Which features are you choosing for for this
milestone?  Level editor by alpha

Test for Acceptance: How do we measure success?  How would you tell
that the milestone was a failure?  How would you like for a
deliverable to be evaluated for a grade?  Concrete goals

Milestone 1: Gameplay Prototype: Deliverables: Test movement on rhythm
(player and enemy) Test tile-based movement Reach goal: rhythm
controller prototype Test for Acceptance Game doesn’t crash for 5
different players Enemies and player are in sync (move at the same
time)
Milestone 2: Technical Prototype Deliverables: Prototype of the
level editor XML parser At least be able to design the layout of a
level Rhythm controller complete Test for Acceptance: 5 different
users are able to construct a level Rhythm controller doesn’t desync
noticeably
Milestone 3: Alpha Release: Deliverables: minimal features
Significant amount of music complete (at least 5 tracks?)  Test for
Acceptance:
