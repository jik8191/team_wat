In doingthis, we integrated the action ticker as well as a more fleshed outgameplay structure.  We also established and began implementing themodular architecture specification on which we will continue to buildour game.  In terms of art assets, more sprites were created for theknight, enemies, ticker, background, and board tiles.  Additionally,an initial music track was created.\section*{Activity Breakdown}\textbf{Charles Tark} \\He was responsible for the implementation of the InputControllermodule, the health-related components, as well as various drawing codethroughout the different modules as necessary.  He was alsoresponsible for the creation of initial visual and audio assets forthe game. Specifically, he was involved with the followingactivities:\begin{itemize}\item Implementing the InputController module (2 hours)\item Implementing player HP in the Knight module (1 hour)\item Implementing drawing of the health, ticker, and background (3 hours)\item Creating visual assets for tiles and the ticker (3 hours)\item Editing the initial music track produced by Austin (3 hours)\item Meeting with the group (working on documents,   discussing game features/development) (8 hours)\end{itemize}In general, the activities listed were a necessary and productive useof time.  He spent time performing the originally plannedtasks with the addition of helping to create the music track.  Ingeneral, helping to create an adequately functioning rhythm elementproved to be more difficult than expected.  In the future, less timewould probably be spent on music.  However, some of the listedactivities were somewhat nonessential specifically for the productionof the technical prototype and could have been less prioritized, suchas the creation of new tile assets.\\\textbf{Gagik Hakobyan} \\He was responsible for creating the framework for our technicalprototype. This consisted of copying over code from the gameplayprototype, as well as creating new classes according to ourarchitecture. He implemented the rhythm controller, as well as thecode in the gameplay controller that interacted with rhythmcontroller. Finally, he was in charge of designing the gameâ€™sarchitecture and creating the workflow and dependency diagrams. Thebreakdown of hours was as follows:\begin{itemize}\item Designing the architecture (2 hours)\item Creating workflow and dependency diagrams (1 hour)\item Meeting with group members(working on documents, discussing game   features/development) (10 hours)\item Implementing RhythmController (8 hours)\item Writing parts of GameplayController that interface with   RhythmController (5 hours)\end{itemize}Overall, he spent around 26 hours on the game, which were mostlyproductive. Rhythm controller took much longer to implement thananticipated, and this took up a majority of his time.\\\textbf{Austin Liu} \\He was responsible for implementing the skeleton of the variouscontroller modules and composing preliminary music themes for thegame. Specifically, he worked on:\begin{itemize}\item Implementing skeleton code for the InputController interface and the   PlayerController and GameplayController classes that implement   InputController. (4 hours)\item Implementing the bulk of the CollisionController module, which handles   bounds checking and collision detection between objects on the game board.   (4 hours)\item Adding some skeleton code and abstract methods to the GameObject   abstract class. (2 hours)\item Composing music for the game (3 hours)\item Meeting to resolve programming and design decisions (4 hours)\item Meeting to produce documents (4 hours)\end{itemize}In total, he spent about 21 hours on the game over the last two weeks. This was largely in line with the plan set out last week to spend 10 hours programming and 4 hours on music.The activities were largely a productive use of time, though he spent about 1 to 2 hours resolving merge issues related to Git. These are becoming less of a problem.\\\textbf{Kylar Henderson} \\She was mostly responsible for all of the small coding miscellaneous tasks. She also spent time leading group meetings. Specifically her time was spent:\begin{itemize}\item Implementing all model classes (6-7 hours)\item Implementing draw code for most of the game (1 hour)\item Meeting with team members (10 hours)\item Making minor tweaks to other group members' code (2 hours)\end{itemize}In total, she spent about 20 hours working on these. Almost all ofthis time was productive and necessary to make the game functional forthe technical prototype. Almost all of the time that needed to bespent was underestimated. All of the tasks ended up being more timeconsuming than originally thought and certain tasks were notconsidered, such as working on other group members' code. For the nexttwo weeks, time allotments will be more lenient, especially for majortasks. \\\textbf{Andrew Halpern} \\He was responsible for designing the technical prototype game leveland creating the tile assets. He also worked with the rest of the teamto discuss gameplay mechanics and the way they will give feedback tothe player. Specifically, he was involved in:\begin{itemize}\item Designing the color scheme and tile assets (2 hours)\item Designing the layouts for the initial gameplay levels and the   level demonstrated at technical prototype (3 hours)\item Brainstorming new ideas for the gameplay mechanics with the   rest of the team (10 hours)\item Creating a new background and start menu screen for the   technical prototype (2 hours)\end{itemize}In total, he spent around 16 hours working on these assets andcollaborating with the rest of the team for the technicalprototype. Designing levels for the technical prototype took a lotlonger than expected based on the complexity of the maps anddiscussing with the rest of the team what mechanics would be feasiblefor the technical prototype. Also, balancing the gameplay levels wasvery challenging and proved to be too difficult for players in theend. For future milestones, designing levels will be easier to testand iterate on with a level editor. \\\textbf{Julia Cole} \\She was responsible for creating and updating the assets for the game and directing other members contributing assets. She was involved in:\begin{itemize}\item Creating an additional monster sprite (2 hours)\item Creating a projectile sprite (10 minutes)\item Altering the player sprite to be more cohesive with the   background (1 hour)\item Creating ``dash'' player sprite (1.5 hours)\item Directing Andrew and Charles on design tasks (1 hour)\item Meeting with teammates (10 hours)\end{itemize}In total, she spent around fifteen hours working on the abovetasks. Workload will increase when a demand for animationincreases. Additional edits to the player sprite is needed, and thewerewolf sprite needs to be cleaned up as well as the skeletonsprite. The dash sprite may need to be edited. Animations may includebasic walk cycles for each character asset. \\\section*{Milestone Predictions}For the alpha release, we plan to implement a level editor with a basic graphical user interface, as well as playable game level.\subsection*{Tests for Acceptance}Both designers, Andrew and Julia, are able to use the level editor todesign the board of the level. We should also be able to parse a JSONrepresentation of a level reliably so that we can test our leveleditor GUI.\\Additionally, we should implement one interesting level that showcasesall of the interesting features of our game and is considered as ``fun''by at least 5 playtesters before our presentation.\subsection*{Risk Assessment}The following are potential risks we may face in regards to implementing our deliverables:The JSON representation of a level is not easy to implement and the level editor module will likely require extensive debugging.Synchronizing the RhythmController module with the music more carefully will likely require extensive testing to determine an optimal margin of error for the player with regard to the player's keyboard timings.\subsection*{Activity Breakdown}\noindent\textbf{Charles Tark}\\Over the next two weeks, Charles will be responsible for theimplementation of the revised health system and the incorporation ofvisual and audio feedback for the players to reflect currentperformance. Additionally, he will be responsible for the creation ofrequired visual assets as well as editing music tracks.His rough time breakdown will be as follows:\begin{itemize}  \item Implementing the revised health system (2 to 3 hours)  \item Implementing the visual and audio feedback in code (4 to 5 hours)  \item Producing necessary visual and audio feedback assets (3 to 4 hours)  \item Editing music tracks (2 to 3 hours)  \item Producing of any other needed visual assets (2 to 4 hours)  \item Meeting with team members (4 - 6 hours)\end{itemize}\noindent\textbf{Gagik Hakobyan}Over the next two weeks, Gagik will be responsible for fleshing outthe rhythm controller to allow us more precise control over actiontimings. This will allow us to implement more complex actions, such adashing and casting freeze, which he will be in charge of implementingas well. The anticipated activity breakdown is as follows:\begin{itemize}\item Revising rhythm controller (6 - 7 hours)\item Implementing dash, fireball, and freeze (4 - 5 hours)\item Assigning tasks and working with programmers to integrate their   code (1 - 2 hours)\item Meeting with team members (4 - 6 hours)\end{itemize}\noindent\textbf{Austin Liu}\\Over the next two weeks, Austin will be responsible for helping Gagikwith improving the quality of the audio visual feedback of thegame. His rough time breakdown will be as follows:\begin{itemize}\item Composing and arranging more music, as well as looking into the   JFugue third party library for writing music in Java to avoid music format   issues (6 hours)\item Working in the code required in the CollisionController and   GameplayController to handle additional additional game actions such   as dashing and projectiles (3 hours)\item Working with Gagik to improve the robustness of the RhythmController   by providing information on how to anticipate beats in music using various   methods (6 hours)\item Meeting with the group (4-5 hours)\end{itemize}\noindent\textbf{Kylar Henderson}\\Over the next two weeks, Kylar will be responsible for leading thework on the level editor. Her rough time breakdown will be as follows:\begin{itemize}\item Researching JSON for use by the level editor and loading in levels   (4-5 hours)\item Implementing a parser that will convert JSON files into levels (6-7 hours)\item Implementing a GUI for players to use to design levels (7-8 hours)\end{itemize}\noindent\textbf{Andrew Halpern}Over the next two weeks, Andrew will be responsible for redesigningvisual assets to help players follow along with the game'srhythm. This includes environmental assets such as tiles andbackground. Andrew will also be responsible for designing the way thenew combo bar and rhythm movement status bar will interact andfeel. He will also begin to brainstorm and create UI elements thathelp teach the players how the core gameplay mechanics work in thebeginning levels. His rough time breakdown will be as follows:\begin{itemize}\item Designing more gameplay levels feature new gameplay mechanics such as   dashing and testing the level editor (5 hours)\item Collaborating with other team members to create the level editor (2 hours)\item Redesigning tile assets to give player more feedback (3 hours)\item Creating new ``ticker'' and ``combo'' meter to reflect changes from   technical prototype   (5 hours)\item Brainstorming and meeting with rest of the team (10 hours)\end{itemize}\noindent\textbf{Julia Cole}Over the next two weeks, Julia will be responsible for directing theproduction of assets. She will continue to refine character design,implement animation for all characters and tweak existing assets.Her rough time breakdown will be as follows:\begin{itemize}\item Polishing character drawings (3 hours)\item Animating walk cycles (10 hours)\item Tweaking graphic design assets (1 hour)\item Checking in with Charles and Andrew to ensure a cohesive design (1 hour)\item Meeting with the team (4-6 hours)\end{itemize}\end{document}
