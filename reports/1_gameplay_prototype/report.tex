Furthermore, we implemented enemy movement that is performedin step to the players' actions, that is, the enemies move only whenthe players do.  In terms of assets, basic sprites were created forthe knight, enemies, ticker, and board tiles.\section*{Activity Breakdown}\textbf{Charles Tark} was responsible for implementation of the InputController module aswell as ensuring that controls and player movement functioned asexpected.  He was also responsible for the synchronizing the movementsof enemies with the players'.  Specifically, he was involved with thefollowing activities:\begin{itemize}\item Implementation of the InputController module\item Debugging of knight movement\item Debugging of the enemy movement\item Synchronizing enemy movement with player movement\item Creation of the game logo\end{itemize}In total, he spent approximately 9 hours working on the associatedtasks.  In general, the activities listed were a necessary andproductive use of time.  However, a lot of time (around 1-2 hours) wasspent configuring the IDE and Git.  In the future, minimal time willbe spent performing such tasks.\\\textbf{Gagik Hakobyan} was responsible for importing the framework for our gameplayprototype. He combined elements of labs 2 and 3 into a single skeletonwith TODOs for each group member to implement. He also spent some timewith Austin and Charles discussing the architecture of both our gameand the gameplay prototype. Specifically he:\begin{itemize}\item Built the project skeleton/framework\item Determined a rough software architecture\item Wrote initialization code for the level\item Assigned rough programming tasks to everyone in the group\end{itemize}In total, he spent around 9 hours working on writing the skeleton andother code associated with the gameplay prototype and an additional2-3 hours discussing the architecture with Austin and Charles.\\\textbf{Austin Liu} was responsible for implementing some modules and working on certain controller modules with Gagik. Specifically, he was involved in:\begin{itemize}\item Implementing the Knight module\item Implementing bounds in the character movement\item Composing and arranging sample music files \item Setting up and maintaining the Git repository, as well as well   as helping resolve configuration issues between Git and IDEs. \end{itemize}In total, he spent about 9 hours working on the above tasks. However,at least 2-3 hours were spent resolving issues related to branchingand merging on Git using both the command line and graphicalinterfaces. These issues should become less problematic now that the.gitignore file has been set up.\\\textbf{Kylar Henderson} was responsible for implementing drawing code for all elements of the prototype and keeping track of team progress. Her main tasks were:\begin{itemize}\item Establishing draw methods for the Knight, Enemies, and Board\item Converting enemy and knight positions to on screen coordinates\item Collaborating with other team members to distribute work \end{itemize}In total, she spent about 5 hours working on these. Most of this timewas spent working with other team members to coordinate plans. In thefuture though, more time will be committed to working on programming.\\\textbf{Andrew Halpern} was responsible for designing the game level for and background for the first level.Specifically, he was involved in:\begin{itemize}\item Designing the tiles for the first level\item Designing the game's rhythm ``ticker'' to show player's status in the game\item Brainstorming new ideas for the game's core mechanics\end{itemize}In total, he spent around six hours working on these assets and collaborating with the rest of the team for the gameplay prototype. \\\textbf{Julia Cole} was responsible for creating assets for the game and directing other members contributing assets. She was involved in:\begin{itemize}\item Creating the player sprite\item Creating the monster sprite\item Directing Andrew and Charles on design tasks\end{itemize}In total, she spent around four hours working on the above tasks. It is expected that the workload for design will increase when we settle on the details of our game. \\Additionally, the group spent about two hours last week and four hours this week on group discussion.\section*{Milestone Predictions}For the technical prototype, we plan to incorporate the rhythmcomponent into our current prototype, such that movement on a rhythmis viable in the style of the puzzler we are considering.Furthermore, we plan to implement and integrate the action ticker intoour prototype as well as win and loss states.  During this time, wewill consider and experiment with various rhythm-based gameplayschemes such that gameplay is not too hectic and/or challenging.  Wewill also complete the architectural specification.\subsection*{Tests for Acceptance}\begin{itemize}\item The rhythm controller doesn't desynchronize noticeably\item Win and loss states function properly and as expected\item The action ticker correctly indicates the next required actions\item Rhythm-based gameplay is integrated such that it is not too   difficult or frustrating\item Players receive visual and/or auditory feedback for   successfully performing certain actions such as matching the rhythm\item The board will be implemented with tiles in a way that is simple\end{itemize}\subsection*{Risk Assessment}\begin{itemize}\item Music may be difficult to synchronize properly with the   actions of all characters\item Identifying an adequate scheme by which we would   integrate rhythm may prove to be challenging\item Certain players may find the combination of rhythm and   puzzle elements to be too difficult or complicated\end{itemize}\subsection*{Activity Breakdown}We intend to allocate 4 hours over the next two weeks to meeting time.\\\noindent\textbf{Charles Tark}Over the next two weeks, Charles will be responsible for helping Gagikin the creation of a new architecture specification, implementing anddebugging any modules necessary for the technical prototype, andcreating any necessary visual assets as specified.The time estimates are as follows:\begin{itemize}  \item Designing the game's architecture with Gagik - 4 to 5 hours  \item Miscellaneous coding necessary - 10 to 12 hours  \item Production of any needed visual assets - 2 to 4 hours\end{itemize}\noindent\textbf{Gagik Hakobyan}Over the next two weeks, Gagik will be responsible for designing thegameâ€™s architecture with Charles, and more specifically with designingthe skeleton for our technical prototype.
