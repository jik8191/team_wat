This folder contains the Lilypond source files used to generate MIDI 
output.

I make heavy use of the articulate script - see 
MIDI articulation in the Lilypond docs - to improve MIDI output

Work to improve music and score rendering is ongoing. To compile, install 
Lilypond and run lilypond on the source .ly file
